    "text": "Hello, my name is Jen Guo (yg429).\nIn this mini project for DSAN 6300, I wanted to analyze my queried data results to capture information about airports and airlines. I wanted to determine patterns in flight delays and cancellations to help travelers have a less stressful travel experience since air-travel can be costly and worrisome.\nIn this project, I wanted to answer if there are patterns in days of the week, certain airlines, and types of airports in relation to delayed and canceled flights. I used data from the al_perf table and the tables from the dimensions tables folder such as airports, airlines, and cancellation tables in my queries to get these flight data."

    "text": "Air-traveling can be quite anxiety inducing for some people. The air travel process, take-offs and landings, plane bookings, packing, canceled flights, and flight delays that interrupt your trip can be a stressful situation. Many unexpected things could happen that could detour your flight plan (McIntosh, 1998). Some factors may be completely out of your control such as bad weather and high volume air traffic. But there are still many factors that you can control to put yourself at an advantage to reduce stress in your air-travel plan. What if we could utilize data to evaluate airports and airlines to avoid delayed and canceled flights?"

As shown in the bar plot below, Saturday may be the best day of the week to fly because it has the lowest total number of flights out of all days of the week and thus lowest ranking in terms of count. The second preferred date of the week to fly would be Wednesday with the second highest total number of flights.

    "text": "5) Are there certain geographical regions/ airport locations that have more flight cancellations?\nIn the third visual, we noticed that airports located in Massachusetts and Texas had more frequent airports with airlines that had high average departure times. Which makes us more curious to know if flight cancellations had patterns related to certain geographical locations?\nWe can observe the locations of the airports, the number of canceled flights from airports, and the reason for flight cancellations in the geographic US map with markers below. The bubble map shows the different cancellation reason by color, which are carrier, national air system, and due to weather. The size of the bubble for each marker of airport location shows the number of flight cancellations.\nCoresponding with the bar chart above, the Dallas/ For Worth International airport in Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas had the highest number of flight cancellations with reason due to weather. Other airport locations with high number of flight cancellations can be found in the state of California, Florida, and along the Northeast coast of the US map. You can also notice airports in landlocked areas/ midwest regions tended to have more frequent flight cancellations due to weather. Airport near the west coast and east cost had more frequent cancellations due to carrier issues.\nOverall, there wasn’t a certain geographic region where airports with canceled flights clustered at. Though some states like Texas, California, and Florida had slightly more airports with canceled flights. The airports with canceled flights were spread throughout the US. Thus, it would be best to always plan ahead and keep in mind of potential canceled flights at airports throughout the US.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidygeocoder)\n#create new column Location to store airport city and state by merging the City and State columns\nCancelled_flights_sep2 &lt;- Cancelled_flights_sep %&gt;%\n    unite(\"Location\", City, State, sep = \", \", remove = FALSE) %&gt;%\ndistinct(Location) %&gt;%\ngeocode(Location, method = \"osm\", lat = lat, long = lon) #get latitude and longtitude of the airport locations\n\n\nPassing 212 addresses to the Nominatim single address geocoder\n\n\nQuery completed in: 232.4 seconds\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#join lat and long data with the cancelled flights data \nmap_cancelled_flights &lt;- Cancelled_flights_sep %&gt;%\n    unite(\"Location\", City, State, sep = \", \", remove = FALSE) %&gt;%\n    left_join(Cancelled_flights_sep2, by = \"Location\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#create US map with markers for airport locations with canceled flights \ng &lt;- list(scope = 'usa',\n         projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),\n         showland = TRUE,\n         landcolor = \"rgb(240, 240, 240)\",\n         subunitwidth = 1,\n         countrywidth = 1,\n         subunitcolor = \"white\", \n         countrycolor = \"white\")\n\nmap_fig &lt;- plot_geo(map_cancelled_flights)\n\nmap_fig &lt;- map_fig %&gt;%\n    add_markers(x = ~lon, y = ~lat,\n               size = ~Number_of_cancellations,\n               color = ~Cancellation_reason,\n               hoverinfo = \"text\",\n               text = ~paste(\"Airport name: \",Airport, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \n                      \"Location: \", Location, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"Cancellation_reason: \", Cancellation_reason, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \"Number of Cancelation: \", Number_of_cancellations),\n                marker = list(sizemode = \"area\", opacity = 0.7))\n\nmap_fig &lt;- map_fig %&gt;%\n           layout(title = \"US Airports with Canceled Flights\", geo = g)\nmap_fig           \n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 3 observations\n\n\nWarning: `line.width` does not currently support multiple values.\nWarning: `line.width` does not currently support multiple values.\nWarning: `line.width` does not currently support multiple values."
